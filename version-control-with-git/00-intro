What's git?
===========
Version control system
Distributed
multi-protocol
Cryptographically secure hashes (later!)
Easy forking, easy merging
Open source, and free as in beer
Not Github

Version Control means never having to say you're sorry 
How I learned to stop worrying and nuked my server
Pick a protocol, any protocol
Stop rewriting history
Easy forking, easy merging = Easy contribution
Don't fear the future
git != github
