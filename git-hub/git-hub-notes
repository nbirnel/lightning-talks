why?
repetitive tasks - adding new repos and forking
avoiding switching window focus
new possibilities

how?
the github api, with wget / curl 
  - lots of learning and scripting
  - just fine for one or two commands
octogit
  - ditto
git hub
  - fairly comprehensive
  - rather large (3754 sloc sh, 98 sloc perl, 57 sloc ruby)
  - already written for you!

what do I use frequently?
  - git hub repo-new <repo>
  - git hub fork <owner>/<repo>
  - git hub repo-edit <repo> description

what looks silly?
  - git hub clone <owner>/<repo>
    (This could just be done with git clone, yes?)

what could be interesting?
  - git hub forks <owner>/<repo> | (get owners) |
    git user <owners> and collate data.
    Ie, what are stats about github usage in our class?

what's the takeaway?
  - Just because there's a web service
    doesn't always mean the browser is the only or best UI for it.
  - Tools you want are often out there (not just gems!)
  - scriptable interfaces are extendable
  - switching window focus can mean switching your focus
  -
