why?
  - repetitive tasks - adding new repos and forking
  - avoiding switching window focus
  - new possibilities

how?
the github api, with wget / curl 
  - lots of learning and scripting
  - just fine for one or two commands
octogit
  - ditto
git hub
  - fairly comprehensive
  - rather large (3754 sloc sh, 98 sloc perl, 57 sloc ruby)
  - already written for you!

git hub installation
  git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/git-hub
  sudo make install
  git hub setup

what do I use frequently?
  - git hub repo-new <repo>
  - git hub fork <owner>/<repo>
  - git hub repo-edit <repo> description

what looks silly?
  - git hub clone <owner>/<repo>
    (This could just be done with git clone, yes?)

what could be interesting?
  forks = `git hub forks --forks UWE-Ruby/AdvancedSummer2014`.split("\n")
  users = forks.map{|u| u.split("/").first}
  n_repos = users.map{|u| `git hub user-get #{u} public_repos`.chomp.to_i}

  def median(array)
    sorted = array.sort
    len = sorted.length
    (sorted[(len - 1) / 2] + sorted[len / 2]) / 2.0
  end

  mean_repos = n_repos.reduce(:+) / users.size.to_f
  median_repos = median n_repos

  ie, what is the mean average of the number of github repos per student?

what's the takeaway?
  - Just because there's a web service
    doesn't always mean the browser is the only or best UI for it.
  - Tools you want are often out there (not just gems!)
  - scriptable interfaces are extendable
  - switching window focus can mean switching your focus
