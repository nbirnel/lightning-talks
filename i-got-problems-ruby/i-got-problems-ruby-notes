language:
  - aliased methods (reduce / inject, etc)
    bloat the docs
    confuse the code
  - too many methods!
    (but sometimes I want them)
  - no real constants
    maybe it's not a big deal, but it scares me
    is it a decision, or something to do with the architecture?
  - no increment / decrement operators
    probably meant as a feature, what with ruby's array methods

culture:
  - Those who do not study Unix will be codemned to repeat it!
    insular mindset - ruby progs alwasy going to be different - not make, apt-get, man
    - rake v make
      "Only have to know ruby, not make" - rake a subset of ruby
      But I need make for other things - instead rake is a 2nd dsl
      often verbose, encourages functional / imperative rather than logic
    - gem / bundle vs *nix package managers
      ignoring PMs generates conflicts (see non-system rubys and readline)
      seems oriented towards programmers (who may wish to have many installs)
        vs users (who would like to simply install a package)
    - man pages
      gem has no way of installing "correctly" (since per-user)
      most gems don't have them
      no infrastructure for them (md2man, etc?)
  - Rails is poisonous
    "magic" is not a complement
    people think Rails == ruby
  - Mac-centric
    OS X a fine media platform 
    pricewise is extremely elitist - per machine, and frequent hardware upgrades
